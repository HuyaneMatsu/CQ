About the HTML file:

Doesnt need internet, it uses built in base64 images. It is 1200px width, so it doesnt prefers mobile devices. It has scrollbar styling in css, what is not supported by some browsers (for example: Mozilla). It uses js, so please turn it on, if you have disabled it, or you will see only a white screen (propably).


About the code: It generates the HTML file.

Requiments: Python 3.6 (or newer), Pillow.
